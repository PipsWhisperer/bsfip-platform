# BSFIP Platform — AI Financial Decision Support System

## Overview

The Botswana Smart Financial Intelligence Platform (BSFIP) is an AI-driven financial decision-support system designed to improve SME financial monitoring and micro-loan risk assessment in emerging economies. The system uses rule-based models and financial data analytics to provide intelligent insights for financial health evaluation, risk prediction, and decision optimization.

This project was developed as a final-year Computer Science and Information Systems & Data Management research project, integrating algorithm design, data governance, and intelligent systems.
